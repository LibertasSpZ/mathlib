# Simple graphs

This module defines simple graphs on a vertex type `V` as an
irreflexive symmetric relation.

There is a basic API for locally finite graphs and for graphs with
finitely many vertices.

## Implementation notes

TODO: This is the simplest notion of an unoriented graph.  This should
eventually fit into a more complete combinatorics hierarchy which
includes multigraphs and directed graphs.  We begin with simple graphs
in order to start learning what the combinatorics hierarchy should
look like.

TODO: Part of would include defining, for example, subgraphs of a
simple graph.

/--
A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `adj` on a vertex
type `V`.  The relation describes which pairs of vertices are
adjacent.  There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent edges;
see `simple_graph.E` for the corresponding type of edges.

structure simple_graph (V : Type u) :=
(adj : V → V → Prop)

(loopless : irreflexive adj . obviously)

/--
The complete graph on a type `V` is the simple graph where all pairs of distinct vertices are adjacent.

  sym := by tidy,

variables {V : Type u} (G : simple_graph V)

/--
The edges of G consist of the unordered pairs of vertices related by
`G.adj`.  It is given as a subtype of the symmetric square.

sets are defined, `G.incident v e` denotes that `v` is incident to `e`.
