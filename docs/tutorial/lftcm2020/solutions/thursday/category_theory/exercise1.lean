/-! Hint 1:
`yoneda` is set up so that `(yoneda.obj X).obj (op Y) = (Y ‚ü∂ X)`
(we need to write `op Y` to explicitly move `Y` to the opposite category).
-/

/-! Hint 2:
If you have a natural isomorphism `Œ± : F ‚âÖ G`, you can access
* the forward natural transformation as `Œ±.hom`
* the backwards natural transformation as `Œ±.inv`
* the component at `X`, as an isomorphism `F.obj X ‚âÖ G.obj X` as `Œ±.app X`.

Notice that we didn't need to provide proofs for the fields `hom_inv_id'` and `inv_hom_id'`.
These were filled in by automation.
