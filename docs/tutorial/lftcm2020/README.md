# Lean for the Curious Mathematician 2020

If you see this on GitHub, you are probably looking for the
[official website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lftcm2020/)
or its source code which is in the `docs` folder.

If you downloaded this using `leanproject` then you probably want to
open this folder in VSCode and start doing the exercises.
For instance, on Tuesday morning, you can do inside this root folder
```
git pull
cp src/exercises_sources/tuesday/sets.lean src/my_exercises/sets.lean
code .
```
And then click on `src/my_exercises/sets.lean` in the VSCode file explorer
to start playing. The reason we don't recommend you edit our source file
directly is your modifications would get overwritten when you'll update
the repository using `git pull`.

An alternative would be to create a branch specifically to complete the exercises in.
